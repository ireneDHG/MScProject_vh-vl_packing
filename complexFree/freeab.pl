# Analysis of the VH/VL packing

# Author:       Irene del Hierro Garc√≠a
# Script name:  freeab.pl
# Version:      V1.1
# Date:         19/08/16
#
#********************************************************************
#
# Purpose
# =======
#        Classify the redundant groups into complex, free or mixed if their antibodies
#        are all complexed, in free-state or both complexed and free respectively, and just give
#        a list of the free redundant groups with their respective standard deviations.
#
#********************************************************************
#
# Assumptions
# ===========
#       1. The program requires an input txt file with a list of antibodies grouped by sequence
#          and an input folder that contains the structures of antibodies (as PDB files).
#       2. The antibodies of the group should be separated by commas in the first line and in the next line 
#          the standard deviation and mean should appear as: "SD: 0.2344455 MEAN: 2.48".
#       3. The results will be printed in screen if an output file is not specified.
#
#       Usage: perl freeab.pl < ../RedundantChothia_AllMeanSD.txt > outputCF.txt
#
#********************************************************************   
# Strategy
# ========
#       1. Open and read each line of the input file.
#       2. Get the names of the antibodies and open their respective PDB files
#       3. Determine if the antibodies are in free-state or bounded with a ligand
#       4. Determine the class of the redundant group when all its antibodies have been analysed.
#       5. Print the results in screen or in file if specified.
