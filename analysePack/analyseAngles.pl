# Analysis of the VH/VL packing

# Script name:  analyseAngles.pl
# Version:      V1.1
# Date:         12/08/16
#
#********************************************************************
#
# Purpose
# =======
#       Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each of the redundant groups in the  
#       RedundantChothia_Angles.txt file
#       In the case of groups formed by one element, the standard deviation is left as undefined.
#
#********************************************************************
#
# Assumptions
# ===========
#       1. The program requires an input txt file with the list of antbodies grouped by sequence and
#          their respective packing angle values below
#       2. The antibodies of the groups as well as the angles in the txt file should be separated by commas
#       3. The location of the modules with the subroutines used in this script should be located in the appropriate path
#          (change the location of the Modules folder to correctly used this program)
#       4. Unless a screen printing is required, add an output file to obtain the results.
#
#       perl analyseAngles.pl < ../RedundantChothia_Angles.txt > ../RedundantChothia_MeanSD.txt 
#
#********************************************************************   
# Strategy
# ========
#       1. Open and read each line of the input file
#       2. Get the angle values for each group
#       3. Calculate the mean and sd and print the results in an output file

#********************************************************************
# Purpose: Process the input file and retrieve a vector with the number of the groups
#          and another vector with the values.
#
# Arguments:
#       none: the input is the input file 
#
# Requirements:
#       1. The file has to have specific format, i.e.:
#       5DFV_1, 5DFV_2, 
#       -48.838169, -45.589493, 
#
# Return:
#       array references of the group numbers and values
#
# If any line is empty, skip it
# If the file does not have that format, there is no guarantee of success
